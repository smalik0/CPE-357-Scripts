README
Author: Sam Malik

Here is a list of all the included scripts, and a brief description of what they do.

Usage:
./<scriptname> <assignmentname> [command line args (only for run and inst)]

complexitystats - calculates desired complexity stats of your code, also saves output of complexity tool to a file
inst - attempts to find and run the instructor executable for the specified assignment-prompts if multiple executables are found (supports command line args)
newtest - creates and runs a new test case (Note: it prompts for command line args to pass to your codde)
PATHS - specifies path to your 357 directory - CHANGE THIS
requirements - creates folder and copies Makefile if absent, and prints requirements, core tests, and feature tests to stdout
run - recompiles and runs your code (supports command line args)
submit - recompiles, stylechecks, runs complexity, zips, and hands in your code
test - runs all test cases at once

TEST CASES
In order to work with this testing system, test cases MUST have any command line args on the first line of the test case file (usually in#, with # being a number). This is the format that ./newtest creates them in, and the format that ./test expects.

KNOWN ISSUES:
./submit does not handin for Project1 due to a difference in Mammen's naming convention; if this persists I'll write a fix
